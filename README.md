## Problem

When maintaining a calendar of events, it is important to know if an event overlaps with another event.

Given a sequence of events, each having a start and end time, write a program that will return the sequence of all pairs of overlapping events.

## Assumptions

Events start and end time are given as timestamps, this is a design decision that will make easier comparission between events and also eliminate a possible complexity from timezones.
